The firmware consists of several components:
- [[Temperature measurement component]]
- [[Temperature calculator component]]
- [[Logger component]]
- [[SPI Master component]]
- [[Coordinator component]]

The communication between components is mostly event based to enable decoupling, thread safety and easy extension.
